for BFS usually we need:
1. of course a queue ;)
2. a variable to keep track of the distance so far (this can be integrated into the queue like in this solution)
3. a fuction or a data structure to get to the adjacent elements from the current element polled from queue
4. a data structure to keep track of which elements have been visited
