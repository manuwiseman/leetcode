1. both arrays need to be sorted, I was trying to only sort g array in the beginning and do binary search with the element in s, it was stupid as the additional complexity be more or less the same and since we need to mark the child who's already content by changing his/her value, the g array will no longer be sorted. 

2. no need to have a count to track the total number of content children, the indexG is doing exactly the same thing.
