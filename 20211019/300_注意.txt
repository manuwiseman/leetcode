1. This problem has two important attributes that let us know it should be solved by dynamic programming. First, the question is asking for the maximum or minimum of something. Second, we have to make decisions that may depend on previously made decisions, which is very typical of a problem involving subsequences.

2. when the nums[i] is greater than the last element in the list, easy, just put it in. if it's not, then here's the tricky part, we will find the first element in the list that's greater or equal to nums[i] and replace it with nums[i], and why this is ok? because 1. this replacement won't change the size of the list so the result should still be legit, 2. it opens door for later elements, i.e. elements that's greater than nums[i] but smaller than the element just being replaced
