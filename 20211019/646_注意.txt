Intuition

If a chain of length k ends at some pairs[i], and pairs[i][1] < pairs[j][0], we can extend this chain to a chain of length k+1.

Algorithm

Sort the pairs by first coordinate, and let dp[i] be the length of the longest chain ending at pairs[i]. When i < j and pairs[i][1] < pairs[j][0], we can extend the chain, and so we have the candidate answer dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1).
