We know that a binary tree can be represented by an array (assume the root begins from the position with index 1 in the array). If the index of a node is i, the indices of its two children are 2*i and 2*i + 1. The idea is to use two arrays (start[] and end[]) to record the the indices of the leftmost node and rightmost node in each level, respectively. For each level of the tree, the width is end[level] - start[level] + 1. Then, we just need to find the maximum width.
