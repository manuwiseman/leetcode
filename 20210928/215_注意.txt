1. the partition funciton will swap move all the elements < nums[pivot] to the left to pviot, and swap(pivot_index, right) is to move pivot index to the right so pivot won't involve with the whole swaping process, after swaping, store_index is the same as pivot_index before swaping, so we can just do swap(store_index, right) to move it back, so we can make sure that nums[pivot] is the pivot-th smallest element in the list.
