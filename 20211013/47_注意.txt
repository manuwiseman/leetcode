1. the difference between my own backtracking and the better (more efficient) solution is the better one sort the array first and then skip the duplicate one by always only picking the 1st element for duplicate values {if (i != 0 && nums[i - 1] == nums[i] && !visited[i - 1]) continue;}, and my own solution will waste time constructing the duplicate lists and do duplicate check before inserting into final result.
