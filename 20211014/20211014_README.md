# my understanding to backtracking problems

basically all the backtracking has the same pattern

1. a list to track the final result
2. backtracking function
3. a condition to insert the candidate into final result list
4. a for loop that start from first elemnt to last
5. a condition to determine when to insert the elemnt into candidate, candidate is usually a list, a string builder, etc
6. whatever set to list or companion array i.e. visited needs to be reset afterwards


3 & 5 are the hardest




today we are still working on search(backtracking, we have resolved 13 backtracking problems): https://github.com/CyC2018/CS-Notes/blob/master/notes/Leetcode%20%E9%A2%98%E8%A7%A3%20-%20%E6%90%9C%E7%B4%A2.md#2-%E7%9F%A9%E9%98%B5%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E8%BF%9E%E9%80%9A%E5%88%86%E9%87%8F%E6%95%B0%E7%9B%AE
