Let us first review the problems of Permutations / Combinations / Subsets, since they are quite similar to each other and there are some common strategies to solve them.

First, their solution space is often quite large:

Permutations: N!N!.

Combinations: C_N^k = \frac{N!}{(N - k)! k!}C 
N
k
​
 = 
(N−k)!k!
N!
​
 

Subsets: 2^N2 
N
 , since each element could be absent or present.

Given their exponential solution space, it is tricky to ensure that the generated solutions are complete and non-redundant. It is essential to have a clear and easy-to-reason strategy.

There are generally three strategies to do it:

Recursion

Backtracking

Lexicographic generation based on the mapping between binary bitmasks and the corresponding
permutations / combinations / subsets.

As one would see later, the third method could be a good candidate for the interview because it simplifies the problem to the generation of binary numbers, therefore it is easy to implement and verify that no solution is missing.

Besides, this method has the best time complexity, and as a bonus, it generates lexicographically sorted output for the sorted inputs.
