basically all the backtracking has the same pattern

1. a list to track the final result
2. backtracking function
3. a condition to insert the candidate into final result list
4. a for loop that start from first elemnt to last
5. a condition to determine when to insert the elemnt into candidate, candidate is usually a list, a string builder, etc
6. whatever set to list or companion array i.e. visited needs to be reset afterwards


3 & 5 are the hardest



so backtracking should be I insert the first element that meets the criteria into candidate list for final result, and leave the rest to backtracking method, e.g.problem like palindrome, we found the first palindrome, and insert that substring into list, and then the rest of the string substring(i+ 1) will be put into backtracking() method to be processed the say way.
