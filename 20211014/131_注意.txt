basically all the backtracking has the same pattern

1. a list to track the final result
2. backtracking function
3. a condition to insert the candidate into final result list
4. a for loop that start from first elemnt to last
5. a condition to determine when to insert the elemnt into candidate, candidate is usually a list, a string builder, etc
6. whatever set to list or companion array i.e. visited needs to be reset afterwards


3 & 5 are the hardest
