Algorithm

For the recursive approach, we maintain some minor "global" state so each recursive call can access and modify the current total sum. Essentially, we ensure that the current node exists, recurse on the right subtree, visit the current node by updating its value and the total sum, and finally recurse on the left subtree. If we know that recursing on root.right properly updates the right subtree and that recursing on root.left properly updates the left subtree, then we are guaranteed to update all nodes with larger values before the current node and all nodes with smaller values after.
