1. I like the hashmap and sort solution (the one that's commented out) better as it's more straight forward and online judge actaully gave better runtime for both time and space complexity.
2. However, time complexity for hashmap and sort solution is still N(LogN) and Multiset and bucket sort solution's time complexity is still O(N), so the latter is bettert
