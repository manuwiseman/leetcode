for bi-directional dp solution, basically we can divide prices array into 2 subarrays dynamically and get the max total profit

1. 2 dp arrays, one starts from left and once starts from right
2. for left we tracks left_min, for right we tracks right_max
3. after populate 2 arrays we will loop one more time, max of left[i] + right[i + 1] will be the max profit


one pass solution is another state machine
