today we are still working on search (backtracking): https://github.com/CyC2018/CS-Notes/blob/master/notes/Leetcode%20%E9%A2%98%E8%A7%A3%20-%20%E6%90%9C%E7%B4%A2.md#2-%E7%9F%A9%E9%98%B5%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E8%BF%9E%E9%80%9A%E5%88%86%E9%87%8F%E6%95%B0%E7%9B%AE

technically we have done the 2nd time on backtracking problems, but after talked to Dong yesterday, it's not a bad idea to revisit the same question a few days in a row for reinforcement, so I am revisiting Sudoku and N-Queens today

on 12/11/2021 17:45 we finished 3rd time of Sudoku and N-Queens problem and we move on to DP https://github.com/CyC2018/CS-Notes/blob/master/notes/Leetcode%20%E9%A2%98%E8%A7%A3%20-%20%E5%8A%A8%E6%80%81%E8%A7%84%E5%88%92.md#leetcode-%E9%A2%98%E8%A7%A3---%E5%8A%A8%E6%80%81%E8%A7%84%E5%88%92
